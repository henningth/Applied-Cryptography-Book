Cryptography is the science of protecting information. 
This information can be *in transit* or *at rest*.

Who is this book for?
=====================
The intended audience of this book.


An applied approach
=====================

This book uses examples and code in Python to illustrate cryptography examples. 

Python was chosen because it is an accessible language, while still being useful in practice. An example is given below::

    print("Hello world")

This will print the string ``Hello world`` in the console.

Interactive Python session (using doctest)::

>>> print("Hello world")
