Introduction
************

Cryptography is the science of protecting information. 
This information can be *in transit* or *at rest*.

Who is this book for?
=====================
The intended audience of this book are students using cryptography in their education. Developers using 
cryptography in their applications will also get something out of the book.


An applied approach
=====================

This book uses examples and code in Python to illustrate cryptography examples. 

Python was chosen because it is an accessible language, while still being useful in practice. An example is given below::

    print("Hello world")

This will print the string ``Hello world`` in the console.

The concepts in this text will be explained using Python code examples, and the emphasis is on examples and experimentation. 
There will also be an emphasis on poor implementation of cryptography in software, and how this can be remedied. In each chapter, 
there are exercises that the reader should solve in order to reinforce understanding of the concepts.
