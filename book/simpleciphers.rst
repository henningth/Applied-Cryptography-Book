Simple Ciphers
**************

Let us begin with some examples of simple ciphers, show how these are implemented in Python, and how they can be broken. 
Another goal of this chapter is to introduce the necessary *terminology* which is used in the rest of the text.

Caesar Cipher
=============
Probably one of the first examples of protecting information was the *Caesar cipher*, 
which was used in the ancient Roman empire for military communications. In this cipher, we have an *alphabet* of letters, 
for simplicity we consider in this example the English alphabet:

.. math::
    \{A, B, C, \ldots, Z\}.

Substitution Cipher
===================
The substitution cipher...

Exclusive OR (XOR)
